        <div class="item item1">Welcome to Grid Design</div>
        <div class="item item2"></div>
        <div class="item item3">
            With the grid I was able to control the size, placement,and span of each block 
            indivisually all at once.   
        </div>
        <div class="item item4">
            As you can see with all the blocks under the same item name and with it's own name each
            item could be altered together or alone.
        </div>
        <div class="item item5">
            The picture is a simmplified version of the code it was the only way
            to fit the important stuff in the image
        </div>
        <div class="item item6">This is the responsive desgin code</div>
        <div class="item item7">
            <img src="images/Second-image.png" id="image2">
        </div>
        <div class="item item8">
            This is the code that allows everything else to work just as well
            on a tablet or phone as it would on a computer 
        </div>
        <div class="item item9">
            This code mainly deals with size as you can see that's because the same size on a computer 
            wouldn't look good on a tablet or phone
        </div>
    </div>
